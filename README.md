## Architectrue based on apache camel DSL description

at prototyping stage we need a robust, flexible, and scalable system architecture, that modular system architecture enables flexible creation and deployment of services.

+ A layered system structure that facilitates rapid creation and replication of services.
+ Implementation of interfaces for the client.
+ Providing a computer with an interface that allows the client to implement a "black box" according to their needs.
+ A modular architecture based on virtual machines (VMs), where each module is an autonomous unit that can be easily replaced.
+ Using Karavan Designer to create processes instead of the traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach.
+ Defining the process flow in an implementation-agnostic way, which enables flexible deployment both in the cloud and in the edge computing environment.

This architecture seems very flexible and scalable. 
It allows for:

+ Easy customization of services to customer needs
+ Fast implementation of new functionalities
+ Efficient resource management through a modular structure
+ Abstraction of business processes from a specific infrastructure

## Layers

It uses proven, open-source technologies, which can make the development and maintenance of the system easier.

### Hypervisor: [Proxmox - KVM](https://www.proxmox.com/en/)
- It is a KVM-based virtualization platform that provides flexible management of virtual machines.

### Operating system: [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/)
- A stable and secure Linux operating system, often used in server environments.

### Operational scripts: [Python v2 / v3](https://www.python.org/)
- A versatile programming language, great for automation and operational scripts.

### Data exchange: [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV)
- An HTTP extension protocol that allows collaboration and management of files on the server.

### DSL API: [Apache Camel - Java](https://camel.apache.org/)
- An integration framework that allows easy connection of different systems and protocols.

### Design: [Karavan](https://camel.apache.org/categories/Karavan/)
- A tool for designing and managing Apache Camel integrations.
