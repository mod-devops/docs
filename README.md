## Architectrue based on apache camel DSL description

at prototyping stage we need a robust, flexible, and scalable system architecture, that modular system architecture enables flexible creation and deployment of services.

+ A layered system structure that facilitates rapid creation and replication of services.
+ Implementation of interfaces for the client.
+ Providing a computer with an interface that allows the client to implement a "black box" according to their needs.
+ A modular architecture based on virtual machines (VMs), where each module is an autonomous unit that can be easily replaced.
+ Using Karavan Designer to create processes instead of the traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach.
+ Defining the process flow in an implementation-agnostic way, which enables flexible deployment both in the cloud and in the edge computing environment.

This architecture seems very flexible and scalable. 
It allows for:

+ Easy customization of services to customer needs
+ Fast implementation of new functionalities
+ Efficient resource management through a modular structure
+ Abstraction of business processes from a specific infrastructure

## Layers

1. Hypervisor: Proxmox (KVM)
- It is a KVM-based virtualization platform that provides flexible management of virtual machines.

2. Operating system: Debian 12
- A stable and secure Linux operating system, often used in server environments.

3. Operational scripts: Python (v2 / v3)
- A versatile programming language, great for automation and operational scripts.

4. Data exchange: WebDAV
- An HTTP extension protocol that allows collaboration and management of files on the server.

5. DSL API: Apache Camel (Java)
- An integration framework that allows easy connection of different systems and protocols.

6. Design: Karavan
- A tool for designing and managing Apache Camel integrations.

 It uses proven, open-source technologies, which can make the development and maintenance of the system easier.

Would you like to discuss in more detail any particular aspect of this architecture or how these components work together?
