## Prototyping stage

### Architectrue based on apache camel DSL description

at prototyping stage we need a robust, flexible, and scalable system architecture, that modular system architecture enables flexible creation and deployment of services.

+ A layered system structure that facilitates rapid creation and replication of services.
+ Implementation of interfaces for the client.
+ Providing a computer with an interface that allows the client to implement a "black box" according to their needs.
+ A modular architecture based on virtual machines (VMs), where each module is an autonomous unit that can be easily replaced.
+ Using Karavan Designer to create processes instead of the traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach.
+ Defining the process flow in an implementation-agnostic way, which enables flexible deployment both in the cloud and in the edge computing environment.

This architecture seems very flexible and scalable. 
It allows for:

+ Easy customization of services to customer needs
+ Fast implementation of new functionalities
+ Efficient resource management through a modular structure
+ Abstraction of business processes from a specific infrastructure

### Layers

It uses proven, open-source technologies, which can make the development and maintenance of the system easier.

### Hypervisor: [Proxmox - KVM](https://www.proxmox.com/en/)
- It is a KVM-based virtualization platform that provides flexible management of virtual machines.

### Operating system: [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/)
- A stable and secure Linux operating system, often used in server environments.

### Operational scripts: [Python v2 / v3](https://www.python.org/)
- A versatile programming language, great for automation and operational scripts.

### Data exchange: [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV)
- An HTTP extension protocol that allows collaboration and management of files on the server.

### DSL API: [Apache Camel - Java](https://camel.apache.org/)
- An integration framework that allows easy connection of different systems and protocols.

### Design: [Karavan](https://camel.apache.org/categories/Karavan/)
- A tool for designing and managing Apache Camel integrations.

### Disadvantages


#### Resource Management:

Proxmox may not be optimized for managing specific GPU resources, which can lead to inefficient use of compute.

#### WebDAV Limitations:

WebDAV may not be optimal for transferring large AI datasets, which can slow down the training and inference process.

#### Integration Complexity:

Integrating different AI components with Apache Camel can require additional work and expertise.

#### Security:

The distributed architecture can increase the attack surface, requiring additional security measures.

#### Updates and Maintenance:

Managing updates and maintenance of multiple distributed entities can be more time-consuming and complex.



## MVP stage based on Openshift

This is flexible and fast AI infrastructure based on OpenShift instead of pure Kubernetes. 
OpenShift, as a containerization platform based on Kubernetes with additional features, can indeed provide a more integrated and enterprise-friendly environment. 

Here is a proposal for such an infrastructure:

1. Foundation: Red Hat OpenShift
- Provides advanced cluster management, built-in CI/CD tools, and strong security.

2. AI/ML management: Red Hat OpenShift AI
- Integrated solution for managing the lifecycle of AI/ML models.
- Includes JupyterHub for interactive model development.

3. Data processing: Apache Spark on OpenShift
- Leverage OpenShift operators to easily deploy and scale Spark clusters.

4. ML orchestration: Kubeflow on OpenShift
- Provides a comprehensive environment for building ML pipelines.

5. Model serving: Seldon Core or KServe
- Allows easy deployment and scaling of ML models as microservices.

6. Data Streaming: Red Hat AMQ Streams (Apache Kafka)
- Provides a reliable platform for processing real-time data streams.

7. API Management: 3scale API Management
- OpenShift-integrated API management solution.

8. Monitoring and Logging:
- Prometheus and Grafana (built into OpenShift)
- EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for advanced log analysis

9. CI/CD: OpenShift Pipelines (powered by Tekton)
- Kubernetes-native continuous integration and delivery tool.

10. Serverless: OpenShift Serverless (powered by Knative)
- Enables deployment of features and applications without having to manage infrastructure.

11. Security:
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes
- Red Hat Quay for secure container image management

12. Storage:
- Ceph Storage for scalable object storage
- OpenShift Data Foundation for persistent volumes

13. Edge Computing: Red Hat OpenShift Edge
- Enables AI applications to be deployed at the edge of the network.

14. Application Development:
- OpenShift Dev Spaces (based on Eclipse Che) for browser-based development environments
- OpenShift Virtualization for deploying traditional containerized applications

15. Integration: Red Hat Fuse
- Based on Apache Camel, it enables easy integration of different systems and services

### Advantages of this infrastructure:
This infrastructure enables rapid development, deployment, and scaling of AI solutions while providing tools to effectively manage the entire application and model lifecycle.

1. Comprehensive solution: All components are integrated and tested for interoperability.
2. Enterprise support: Red Hat provides support for the entire technology stack.
3. Manageability: A single interface for managing all aspects of the infrastructure.
4. Scalability: Easily scale from single machines to geographically distributed clusters.
5. Security: Built-in enterprise-level security.
6. Portability: Deploy to cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments.
7. Automation: Advanced ML/AI process automation capabilities.




## MVP stage based on Kubernetes

Once the prototype is up and running, depending on your needs, we can use:

1. Infrastructure:
- Use Kubernetes as a container orchestration platform. This will allow for flexible resource management and scaling.
- Use a hybrid cloud that combines local resources (for sensitive data) with public cloud services (for flexibility and computing power).

2. Virtualization:
- Instead of full virtualization, containerization (Docker) for better performance and easier management.

3. API Management:
- API Gateway (e.g. Kong or Apigee) to manage, monitor, and secure APIs.

4. API Design and Documentation:
- OpenAPI for easy API design and documentation.

5. Serverless Computing:
- a serverless platform (e.g. Knative on Kubernetes or AWS Lambda) for microservices and functions, which will simplify deployment and scaling.

6. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
- GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins to automate development and deployment processes.

7. Database:
- Scalable databases such as PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time series data or MongoDB for unstructured data.

8. Data Processing and AI:
- Apache Spark for processing large data sets.
- Kubeflow for orchestrating machine learning tasks on Kubernetes.

9. Frontend:
- React or Vue.js framework for web applications.
- Use React Native or Flutter for mobile applications, allowing for code sharing across platforms.

10. Monitoring and Logging:
- ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack or Prometheus with Grafana for monitoring and log analysis.

11. Security:
- HashiCorp Vault for managing secrets and keys.
- Service Mesh solutions (e.g. Istio) for advanced traffic management and security at the microservice level.

12. Process Design:
- Apache Camel K on Kubernetes for defining and implementing integrations and business processes.

13. Application Development:
- low-code/no-code approach (e.g. OutSystems or Mendix) for rapid development of business applications.


### This architecture offers:

- Flexibility in scaling and resource management
- Ease of defining and deploying new services
- Efficient data processing and AI calculations
- Rapid development and deployment of web and mobile applications
- Advanced monitoring and security capabilities
